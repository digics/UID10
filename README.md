## Summary

uid is the user level awk library that is able to generate unique string with cotrolled structure

hid is the part of the uid library. it's able to operate with the "strong values" 

For those who write long programs in AWK, pointers and working with strong values are essential.
I recommend the UID library.


## How to use

just include file 'uid.lib' in your gawk project.

Library have automatic dynamic initialization so the place of including doesn't matter.
